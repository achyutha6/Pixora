# 📌 Project Overview

Pixora is a full-stack web application designed to provide users with a seamless platform for uploading, managing, and interacting with digital images.

The project focuses on clean architecture, scalable design, and efficient client-server communication while following modern web development best practices.

Pixora demonstrates strong implementation of React-based frontend development, REST API integration, and structured backend organization.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

With the rapid growth of digital content, users generate and manage large volumes of image data. However:

* Many platforms lack optimized performance.
* Managing and retrieving images efficiently is challenging.
* Scalable and modular image systems are required.
* Clean UI and responsive experience are often missing.

Pixora addresses these challenges by providing:

* Structured image handling
* Responsive and interactive UI
* Optimized API communication
* Modular and maintainable architecture

---

# 🎯 Objectives

The primary objectives of Pixora are:

* Build a responsive and user-friendly interface.
* Implement efficient frontend-backend communication.
* Follow scalable and modular architecture principles.
* Demonstrate production-ready project structure.
* Ensure maintainability and clean coding standards.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

## 🖥 Frontend

* React.js
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* HTML5
* CSS3

Why React?

* Component-based architecture
* Virtual DOM for performance optimization
* Reusable UI components
* Strong ecosystem and scalability

---

## ⚙ Backend (If Applicable)

* Node.js
* Express.js

Why?

* Non-blocking architecture
* Fast API response handling
* Lightweight and scalable server structure

---

## 🗄 Database (If Applicable)

* MongoDB

Why?

* Flexible document-based storage
* Ideal for storing image metadata
* Easy scalability for large datasets

---

# 🏗️ System Architecture

Pixora follows a **Client-Server Architecture**:

User → React Frontend → REST API → Backend Server → Database

### Workflow:

1. User interacts with the React UI.
2. Frontend sends API requests to the backend.
3. Backend processes logic and communicates with the database.
4. Data is returned to frontend.
5. UI updates dynamically.

This ensures:

* Separation of concerns
* Scalability
* Improved maintainability
* Secure data handling
